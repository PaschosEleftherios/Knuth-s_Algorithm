# Knuth-s_Algorithm
My very first programming assignment.
A program to find a 4 digit number in max 5 attempts.

How it works:

1)Write a 4 digit number in a paper.
  Number's allowed are from 1 to 6.
  
2)You will be asked to give a response in the computer's guess,until your number is revealed.(Be sure it will)
  Response is a feedback containing 'o' followed by 'x'.
  For every digit in the computer's guess,that is the same digit and in the same position with your number type just 'o'
  without telling which digit or in which position.
  For every digit in the computer's guess,that is the same digit but not in the same position with your number type just 'x'
  without telling which digit or in which position.
  If you have not any same digits leave feedback blank and continue.
  For example, if my number=2365 and the programm's guess is 3462 the correct response is oxx because we have the digit 6
  in the same position and the digits 2 and 3 in wrong positions.(See that i am not giving any information about which digits
  and in which position.)
  
3)At most 5 attempts you will see the number you have written in your paper in your screen.
